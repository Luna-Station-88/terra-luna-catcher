# Terra Luna Catcher
This source code is used to catches the Luna falling into the wallet and forwards it on to desired wallet.
How it can be used is totally up to you.

## Overview

This code periodically checks the balance (LUNA token only) of the source wallet for which you have a mnemonic phrase. If an amount equal to 1 Luna or more appears on the source wallet, then the code automatically and unconditionally transfers almost the entire amount to the target wallet that was specified at the start of this script.
The main source of inspiration was ([this code](https://github.com/terra-money/oracle-feeder)).

### WARNING

The script does not check that the target wallet belongs to you, therefore, when you run the script, ALWAYS check the address of the target wallet.
We are NOT RESPONSIBLE if the script sends money to the wrong address.
We recommend that you check the script by sending a small amount to the source wallet to make sure that the transfer is being made to the target wallet you need.
